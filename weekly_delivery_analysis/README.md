# 🍦 Weekly Delivery Analysis

This Python script simulates a weekly delivery summary for a fictional food delivery business specializing in desserts and frozen treats. It collects daily delivery counts from the user and provides insights into workday performance versus weekend demand.

## 📌 Key Features
- Prompts user input for deliveries each day of the week
- Calculates:
  - Total weekly deliveries
  - Deliveries made on working days (Monday–Friday)
  - Deliveries made on the weekend (Saturday–Sunday)
- Compares delivery statistics:
  - Whether Sunday outperformed Saturday
  - Whether weekdays had higher delivery volume than the weekend
  - Whether the week was “successful” (total > 1000 or weekend > 500)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data types: integers
- Operators: arithmetic (`+`), logical (`>`, `or`, etc.)
- Output formatting: f-strings

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Open your terminal or code editor
3. Run the script using:

   `python weekly_delivery_analysis.py`

4. Enter the number of deliveries for each day when prompted

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- Handling user input
- Using variables and performing arithmetic operations
- Applying logical comparisons and conditions
- Formatting output for clear data presentation
