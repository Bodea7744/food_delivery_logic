# üç® Food Delivery Logic

Welcome to **Food Delivery Logic**, a curated collection of beginner-to-intermediate Python scripts focused on simulating and analyzing operations in a fictional dessert delivery system. Each task in this repository was carefully designed to cover key programming concepts while maintaining thematic consistency across real-world scenarios like deliveries, orders, recipient validation, and status-based discounts.

## üéØ Purpose

This project showcases the evolution of core Python skills applied to a unified domain ‚Äî food delivery. Each module is a stand-alone educational task, and together they form a modular toolkit that demonstrates:
- Structured data handling
- Logical branching
- Interactive user input
- Condition-based processing
- Custom function usage

| `weekly_delivery_analysis` | Collects daily delivery counts and analyzes total, weekday vs. weekend performance |
| `advanced_weekly_delivery_analysis` | Adds conditional logic and threshold checks across weekend and daily deliveries |
| `delivery_order_validation` | Validates delivery item count, price, and payment status using `while` loops |
| `recipient_name_validation` | Iteratively checks recipient names for vowel presence using a custom function |
| `recipient_delivery_analysis` | Evaluates recipient history, spending, and calculates loyalty-based discounts |
