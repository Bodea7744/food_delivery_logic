# 🍦 Advanced Weekly Delivery Analysis

This Python script performs an advanced analysis of dessert delivery volumes over a full week for a fictional food delivery business. It collects daily delivery inputs and provides comparative insights between days and periods — with a spotlight on weekend performance.

## 📌 Key Features
- Accepts user input for deliveries from Monday to Sunday
- Calculates:
  - Total deliveries across the week
  - Workday delivery count (Monday–Friday)
  - Weekend delivery count (Saturday and Sunday)
- Inline comparison of Saturday vs Sunday delivery stats
- Evaluates workday vs weekend performance
- Assesses whether one or both weekend days surpassed 100 deliveries using logical operators

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Core functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data types: integers
- Operators: arithmetic (`+`), comparison (`>`), logical (`and`, `or`)
- Control flow: `if`, `else`, inline `if`
- Output: formatted via f-strings

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
2. Open your terminal or preferred IDE
3. Run the script using:

   `python advanced_weekly_delivery_analysis.py`

4. Input the number of daily deliveries as prompted

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- Grouping and summarizing user input
- Logical decision-making with conditions
- Comparative output using control structures
- Clean and readable reporting of business insights
- Progression in complexity from basic analysis to logical branching
