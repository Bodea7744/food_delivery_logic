# 📊 Recipient Delivery Analysis

This Python script evaluates the delivery history of individual recipients in a dessert delivery platform. It analyzes yearly delivery totals and spending patterns, determines customer status, and calculates applicable discounts for future orders.

## 📌 Key Features
- Accepts recipient name and ensures it includes both first and last names
- Takes input for total number of deliveries over the past year
- Iterates through each delivery to gather payment amounts
- Detects high-value deliveries over 10,000 lei
- Classifies the recipient as `VIP` or `STANDARD` based on their spending and activity
- Calculates and applies a discount on the recipient's next delivery

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`
- Loops: `while`, `for`
- Conditionals: `if`, `else`
- List operations and string splitting
- Function definition and return values

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Ensure Python 3 is installed
2. Open your terminal or code editor
3. Run the script using:

   `python recipient_delivery_analysis.py`

4. Follow the prompts to provide recipient details, delivery history, and the price of the next scheduled delivery

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- String manipulation and validation
- User input processing and data aggregation
- Logical branching and custom condition evaluation
- Function encapsulation and return-based decision-making
- Interactive pricing simulation with discount application
