# 📦 Delivery Order Validation

This Python script simulates a validation process for dessert delivery orders placed through a fictional food delivery platform. It ensures input accuracy for item count, total price, and payment status before a delivery is allowed to proceed.

## 📌 Key Features
- Accepts user input for:
  - Number of items (must be between 1 and 50)
  - Delivery price (must be greater than 0)
  - Payment status (must be one of: `paid`, `unpaid`, `pending`)
- Ensures proper validation through `while` loops
- Displays appropriate confirmation or error messages based on conditions
- Prevents unconfirmed deliveries from being processed

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Built-in functions: `input()`, `print()`
- Data types: `int`, `float`, `str`
- Operators: comparison (`>`, `<=`, `==`), logical (`or`)
- Control structures: `while`, `if`, `elif`, `else`

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Open a terminal or code editor
3. Run the script using:

   `python delivery_order_validation.py`

4. Follow the prompts to enter delivery details

## 💡 Skills Showcased
- Looping with conditional validation
- Type conversion for user inputs
- Branching logic with multiple decision paths
- Interactive error handling and feedback
- User-friendly output design
